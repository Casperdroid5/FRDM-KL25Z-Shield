# FRDM-KL25Z-Shield
Shield with some usefull components, for educational purposes.
The shield is fully open source and may be changed to your likings, feel free to credit me.

The Shield was designed in EasyEda since this was my first real pcb designing experience. It should be possible to convert this to other programs, but I do not recommend it.
